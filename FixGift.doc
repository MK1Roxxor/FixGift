 INTRODUCTION
 ------------

 Back in 2000 Potion released "Gift", a great 64k intro. Depending on
 the used OS and/or SetPatch version it can happen that the intro
 freezes during startup. The reason for this is an incorrect call
 of Draw() (a graphics library function) to draw the progress bar.
 The code relies on register A1 to be unchanged, this however only
 works by pure luck on some OS versions as A1 is a scratch register.
 Usually Draw() modifies this register which in turn leads to a trashed
 RastPort pointer which makes the intro freeze.


 HOW
 ---

 FixGift simply patches the Draw() routine to preserve register A1 and
 runs the intro. Upon exit all patches will be removed.
 It should work with all versions of "Gift" as no binary changes are done
 but I have only tested it with the final version.


 REQUIREMENTS
 ------------

 As the intro requires OS V39+ FixGift will also require at least V39+.
 FixGift will only run from CLI/Shell and has no Workbench support.


 USAGE
 -----

 There is only one parameter and this is the path to the intro file.
 Example: FixGift DATA:Demos/Gift.exe


 SOURCE
 ------

 The full assembler source code is included in the FixGift archive.
 It was created using ASM-Pro V1.16d but should be easy to use with
 any other assembler as well. In case of questions just contact me.


 CONTACT
 -------

 FixGift was created by StingRay/Scarab^Scoopex in March 2020, in case of
 any problems you may drop me a mail at stingray_dsd@gmx.de
